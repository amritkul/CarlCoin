Intro
---------------------
Carl Coin is a free open source bro-to-bro electronic cash system that is
completely bro'd out. Meaning if one bro goes down, we keep on going, because we ain't pussies.
Users hold their tags to their own stacks and push with each other, to realize those sweet sweet gains.



Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Dogecoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
        `sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/CarlCoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/CarlCoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/CarlCoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/CarlCoind (headless, 64-bit)
